# Zomato-Restaurant-Rating
How to predict the future rating of a restaurant based on an ML model. A case study in Python
Restaurant rating prediction case study in python
Case Studies-Python, Machine Learning

Zomato, the online food app, has reached out to you to help them to predict how good or bad a restaurant will turn out in the future. So that, they can take a decision to include the restaurant in their app or remove it.

They have shared the data of 9551 restaurants from all over the world which are currently present in the Zomato App. It contains the details about the restaurants and what rating it achieved finally.

Our task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Rating of a restaurant based on its characteristics.

The flow of the case study is as below:

Reading the data in python

Defining the problem statement

Identifying the Target variable

Looking at the distribution of Target variable
Basic Data exploration

Feature Engineering

Rejecting useless columns

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)

Feature Selection based on data distribution

Outlier treatment

Missing Values treatment

Visual correlation analysis

Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)

Converting data to numeric for ML

Sampling and K-fold cross validation

Trying multiple Regression algorithms

Selecting the best Model

Deploying the best model in production
